   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers:**
   ```bash
   npm run install-browsers
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
npm start
```

### Custom Keywords
Edit the `keywords` array in `scraper.js` to search for different provider types:

```javascript
const keywords = [
  'obgyn',
  'obstetrician gynecologist', 
  'doula',
  'gynecologist',
  'birthing center',
  'hospital',
  'women\'s health clinic',
  'midwife'
];
```

### Configuration Options

You can modify these settings in `scraper.js`:

- **Max pages per keyword**: Change `maxPages` parameter in `scrapeKeyword()` calls
- **Delay between requests**: Modify `delay()` calls for different timing
- **Output format**: Results are saved to both CSV and JSON by default

## Output Files

The scraper generates two output files:

1. **`healthgrades_results.csv`** - Spreadsheet-friendly format
2. **`healthgrades_results.json`** - Structured data format

## Sample Output

```json
{
  "keyword": "obgyn",
  "name": "Dr. Jane Smith",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
  "address": "123 Medical Center Dr, New Orleans, LA 70112",

}
```

## Error Handling

The scraper includes robust error handling:
- Network timeouts and retries
- Missing data field handling
- Graceful degradation when selectors change
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Web scraping may be subject to terms of service and legal restrictions. Please ensure you:

- Review Healthgrades.com's Terms of Service
- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting
- Use data responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws
- Consider reaching out to Healthgrades for API access if available

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No results found**: The website structure may have changed. Check the console output for selector information.

2. **Browser launch errors**: Ensure you've run `npm run install-browsers`

3. **Network timeouts**: Increase timeout values in the code or check your internet connection

4. **Rate limiting**: Increase delays between requests if you encounter blocking

// In scraper.js, change:
headless: false
```
